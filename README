I have a tonne of end of day MetaStock data.  I have this tool XYZ but
it expects data in OMZ format, one stock at a time.
I have found this converter ABC:
  http://www.example.com/ABC.html
but they discontinued the software and they don't respond to my emails.
Does anyone have any other converters or a copy of ABC? 


HELP PLEASE!!  I've just spent almost two days trying to import intraday
Metastock data into XYZ and I've given up.  Importing Metastock EOD data
is however very easy; but I don't know what the problem is when I try to
import 1-min or 5-mn intraday Metastock data into XYZ.


If you don't know what we're on about you'll be fine, you have no real
use for uterus and need not read on.  The uterus experiment attempts to
provide a concept to solve aforementioned problems.

It's the vision of a bunch of guys with a strong emphasis on data
integrity and maintainability.  We constantly moan about the lack of
standards, poor documentation of market-typical solutions and longevity
of established formats.

While there are several good solutions out there to store massive
amounts of intraday tick data, there is not a single good way to
actually get the data there.  Every data provider comes up with their
own more or less suitable ad-hoc idea of a file exchange format.

Being deliberately vague, uterus promises nothing and keeps probably
even less.  It is irregularly maintained and by no means complete.
